Hi @subhashish.mishra@anz.com
     Hope you're doing good! Apologies for the delay. My AnZ email is not working now inside my VDI. still i am facing issues on my VDI. So that I am sending this from my wipro email.

Risk Adaptor UC1 Status...

Things Done...

-> Development of consumer and prod using dotnet programming  API's are done
-> API's to keep listening the NAS drive for picking up the .csv files
-> .csv parser is implemented which pulls the csv file and convert into objects
-> Generic Json conversion Adaptor is implemented which pulls any form of file and convert that into JSON object for now it suports all types of csv file.
-> Kafka client is added to the dotnet functions, which can connect to the kafka bootstrap server and producer the message to the topics available.
-> Implemented the containerization using the docker image which can build all the code and converts into a single image url which can be deployed anywhere on containerized platforms from the appropriate container registries.


Things Pending ...

-> Pushing it to the Event Mesh that is AnZ's confluent kafka server
-> Automating the CI/CD deployments using git actions


Blockers...

-> Inside the VDI we are unable to connect to confluent kafka which we have created for trial
-> Also bringing our code inside the VDI is really hard each time we are doing the line by line copy from our local wipro laptops to VDI
-> Waiting for the AnZ's confluent kafka event mesh details.


Once we get this AnZ Confluent details we configure it once and test inside the VDI and then will push the code to the GitHub. It takes only a max of 4 to 5 days to complete UC1 once we have this confluent details ready.
We are following up @sanjay.behera@anz.com and he is following up with the event mesh team, since lack of resources running with low man power. he is unable to get it for now.


Risk Adaptor UC2 Status...

-> We started building the pipelines for UC2 it almost done with the consumer part and NAS drive storage it will be done max by 3rd week of this month.


Note : Internal End to End demo video is attached in this email.
